README for Maplets, 30 May 2006

Caveats
-------
* You should probably be a programmer familiar with MIDP to build and
  use this program
* The MIDlet is parametrised using its JAD file which is constructed
  from etc/maplets.properties
* If the target device does not support JSR-75, FileMapCache can't be
  used, use RmsMapCache instead --- edit WhereMIDlet.java
* The RMS can grow indefinitely; this needs to be fixed, see RmsMapCache
* The basic coordinate mapper, org.syzygy.gps.Googler no longer
  works; version 2 is now the default, org.syzygy.gps.Googler2

Prerequisites
-------------
* A GPS receiver which reports location using NMEA sentences
* A MIDP device which is capable of connecting to the GPS receiver
  via the Generic Connection Framework (javax.microedition.io.*)
  and which can connect to the Internet with HTTP
* Ant (http://ant.apache.org), javac, Sun's wireless toolkit,
  (http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/) and antenna
  (http://antenna.sourceforge.net) to build the MIDlet

Testing
-------
* This MIDlet has been tested under me4se 
  (http://http://kobjects.sourceforge.net/me4se/) with Impronto
  (http://www.rococosoft.com) on Linux with the BlueZ stack.
* It has also been run on a Sony-Ericsson k750i
* If you get it working on another device, please let me know.
